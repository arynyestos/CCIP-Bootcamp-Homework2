# CCIP Bootcamp Day 2 Homework

On day 2 of the course, the assignment was to create a test on Hardhat using the [Chainlink Local Simulator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local) for the [Cross-Chain Name Service](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-cross-chain-name-service) project. You can find the test I wrote [here](https://github.com/arynyestos/CCIP-Bootcamp-Homework2/blob/main/test/CrossChainNameServiceTest.ts). The code is well commented, so I don't think there's need for further explanations in this REAMDE ðŸ˜Š
